*********************************************************************

icstogcal is a Java tool in development.

It will allow you to upload events from an ics file (RFC 2445) to a
google calendar.

Requirements :
	* gdata (google java library): 
		http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide_java.html
	* ical4j: 
		http://wiki.modularity.net.au/ical4j/

///////////////////////////// TODO /////////////////////////////////

Currently, the programme can parse and send a ics calendar to a 
google calendar.

An update method should be implemented to avoid duplication of 
events.
